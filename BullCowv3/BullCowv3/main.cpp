 Game works like this.
 1. Print an intro, once per run.
 2. Print rules for the game (word length, max number of tries)
 3. Game chooses an isogram from const array.
 4. Run the play sequence:
    a. Get Guess from player.
    b. Check Guess for Bulls and Cows (Bull = correct position; Cow = wrong position)
    c. Provide player a count for # of Bulls and Cows
    d. If # of Bulls = Word Length, they win this round. Else, repeat this sequence.
 5. Ask if they want to play again. If so, start from 2.
